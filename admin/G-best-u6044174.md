My most useful piece of code is BoardState.java, which was written almost entirely by myself. It abstracts the board so
that we don't have to deal with the string encryption of pieces provided and we have a much nicer interface to work with.
It contains several useful methods including those to find scores for each player, break ties and determine whether
moves are valid. It sees extensive use throughout the rest of the project.

My other main contribution is the UI of the game. The UI was designed and implemented in its entirety by me, with
reference to some resources on UI implementation in JavaFX. Features include animations when the AI makes its move
and a general user-friendly atmosphere.
